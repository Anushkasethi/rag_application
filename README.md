# RAG Application
![RAG Application](https://github.com/Anushkasethi/rag_application/blob/master/example.png?raw=true)
## Overview  
This project is a FastAPI-based document retrieval system that supports **semantic and keyword search**.  
The application processes uploaded **PDF documents/HTML Websites** and allows users to query them efficiently.  
The system integrates **NLP techniques and APIs** to enhance the relevance of retrieved results.

---

## Features
- **PDF Processing**: Parses uploaded PDFs and extracts text for indexing.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses spaCy for embedding-based search.
- **Keyword Search**: Implements traditional keyword-based retrieval using BM25.
- **Result Optimization**: Leverages Cohere API for post-processing to refine search results.
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Optimized through model quantization and replacement of high-memory components.

---

## Deployment Attempts  
The application was tested for deployment on two platforms: **Render** and **AWS**. Below are the challenges encountered and solutions attempted.

### Render Deployment Issues
#### 1. Server Unhealthy (Memory Exhaustion)  
- Render's free tier provides **512MB RAM and 0.1 CPU**, which was insufficient.
- **Memory Profiling Identified Sentence-Transformers as the Issue**:  
  - Initial Memory Usage: **~244 MiB**  
  - Performed **quantization**, reducing memory usage to **~98 MiB**.  
  - Removed **GraphRAG optimization** and focused only on keyword and semantic search.  
  - Replaced **Sentence Transformers** with a lightweight **spaCy model**, reducing memory from **~244 MiB to ~9 MiB**.

#### 2. CORS Issue  
- Initially blocked due to missing CORS headers.
- Fixed by adding **`mode: no-cors`** on the frontend to bypass restrictions.

---

## AWS Deployment Issues
#### 1. IP Address Not Accessible (Permission Issues)  
- Deployed backend on an **AWS EC2 instance**.
- Copied over files and started the **FastAPI** server.
- However, the frontend failed to connect due to **network/permission restrictions**.
- Investigated **security group settings and port accessibility**, but the issue persisted.

---

## Technical Experiments (Not Included in Final Codebase)
### 1. GraphRAG Implementation  
- Initially implemented **GraphRAG** to optimize search results by merging structured knowledge with traditional retrieval.
- Later removed due to **high computational overhead**.

### 2. Out-of-Context Query Handling  
- **Graph-Based Ranking**: Instead of linking adjacent edges, experimented with **PageRank** to connect graph edges dynamically.  
- **CLIP Model for Chunk Filtering**: Integrated **CLIP model** to filter irrelevant document chunks based on query relevance.  
- While effective, this was removed to **reduce complexity and compute cost**.

---

## How It Works
1. **User Uploads a PDF** via the frontend.
2. **Processing Begins**:  
   - The document is parsed and indexed.  
   - Both **semantic and keyword search** techniques are applied.  
3. **Search Execution**:  
   - User submits a query.  
   - The system performs a **hybrid retrieval** using both methods.  
4. **Post-Processing with Cohere API**:  
   - The results are **refined and displayed** based on semantic relevance.

---

## Future Improvements
- Optimize deployment on **cloud platforms** to ensure scalability.
- Enhance **Out-of-Context Detection** for improved query relevance.
- Refine **Ranking Mechanisms** by integrating newer **NLP models** with lower memory consumption.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the development of an optimized **document retrieval system** using **FAISS indexing, BM25, and Cohere API**.  
While deployment challenges were encountered, significant improvements were made in **memory optimization, retrieval accuracy, and query handling**.  
Future iterations will focus on **resolving deployment issues** and **enhancing model efficiency**.
